# Project-4-The-Web-5
For this project, we decided to redesign Jim Davis’s website. This project uses the Ruby Gem middleman to build the website. The website was redesigned by incorporating CSS and some more HTML elements to make the website look nicer and more user-friendly. The website can be viewed using middleman commands (“bundle exec middleman build” followed by “bundle exec middleman server”).

# Sprint #1
Overall/Meeting Project Manager - Roberto De Jesus
Implementation Manager - Quantez Merchant
Documentation Manager - Gavin Adams
Testing Manager - Amyas Dawson

We will be redesigning Jim Davis’ web page

Parts of the page (to be implemented using partials):
Amyas will create the header which will be the same on each page
Roberto will create the footer that will be the same on each page
Quantez will create the navigation bar as part of the header
Gavin will create code for organizing the different parts of the pages using CSS Grid

Body of each page:
Gavin will organize and write the body for the professor’s contact information
Amyas will organize and write the body for the main page
Roberto will organize and write the body for his publications page
Quantez will organize and write the body for his teaching page

# Sprint #2
Roberto created the files for the body of the publications page and the footer for all pages. Roberto redesigned Jim Davis’s publications page by adding selectable dropdowns for each year that Professor Davis had a publication. Roberto highlighted Professor Davis’s name in the author list to easily view how significant his contributions to these publications were. Roberto added icons for each link to the publications. Roberto added a footer that contained Jim Davis’s contact information. Roberto created CSS styling for the publications page, and made edits to the overall CSS. Roberto documented all of his contributions.

Quantez created the files for the teaching page and the materials page. Quantez wrote/edited the code for those pages and wrote css for those pages. Quantez also created the navbar in the layout file that appears on each page and the css for the navbar. To see a more detailed view of the contributions by Quantez, please view the documentation for each of the files mentioned above.

Gavin created the css grid layout for the layout of the entire site (standardized across each page) for the header, footer, navigation bar, and general page body. He created the header and footer in layout.erb but only contributed to the layout of the header. Gavin also created css layout to add 5 boxes in contact.html.erb for giving directions. Gavin created the page for directions to Jim Davis’ office. Gavin styled the titles for each page.

Amyas worked on the index.html.erb file and the header in the site.css.scss and layout.erb files. Amyas’s redesign choice was to condense the clutter of the page using a dropdown feature.
