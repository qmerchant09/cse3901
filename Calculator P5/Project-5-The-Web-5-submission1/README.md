Use cases
User enters numbers
User enters arithmetic operators
User enters a decimal point
User evaluates expression entered
User entered the wrong number and wants to only clear the current entry
User wants to clear the display
User clears memory
User views memory
User enters the current value on the display into memory
User wants to add/subtract the current value on display and the most recent value in memory
Functionality and allocation of work

Evaluation
Roberto will implement addition
Amyas will implement subtraction
Gavin will implement multiplication
Quantez will implement division
Amyas will implement adding values from button presses into an expression (adds button presses to an object to then be parsed)
Gavin will implement parsing the expression and choosing which function to use

HTML and CSS
Gavin will create the CSS grid layout
Roberto will create the buttons and make them interactable
Quantez will create the display and have it show the last expression
Amyas will create a tutorial for the calculator (calculator at the top of webpage and tutorial [written explanation] underneath)

Memory
Quantez will implement storing the memory
Amyas will implement storing the history (readOnly and saves every expression. Cannot be cleared)
Quantez will implement clear memory function (MC)
Roberto will implement the clear entry functionality (CE: clears the last element currently displayed on the calculator)
Amyas will implement the clear display functionality (C: clears the full expression currently displayed/being calculated including the latest element)
Gavin will implement functionality for pushing the current number on screen into memory (MS)
Roberto will create functionality for adding the current value on screen to the most recent memory entry (M+)
Gavin will create functionality for subtracting the current value on screen from the most recent memory entry (M-)
Quantez will create functionality for displaying the most recent value in memory (MR)

Extra (if we have time)
Quantez will implement square root
Roberto will implement exponentiation
Gavin will implement logs
Amyas will implement 1/x (inverse)


# Sprint #2:

Run this project by entering “middleman server” into the console

Overall project manager: Amyas Dawson
Amyas wrote the subtraction, clear, addToHistory, and displayHistory JavaScript methods. Amyas also made the calculator tutorial that explains the functionality and how to use the various buttons. Amyas documented his contributions as comments in the various files. 

Implementation manager: Roberto De Jesus
Roberto wrote the add and exponentiation operation functions as well as the clearEntry and mAdd functions. Roberto created test cases for the operation functions. Roberto created and styled the calculator buttons. Roberto documented all of his contributions. 

Documentation manager: Quantez Merchant
Quantez created the file index.html. Quantez wrote/edited code in both operators.js and index.html. To see a more detailed view of the contributions made by Quantez, please view the documentation for each of the files mentioned above. 

Testing manager: Gavin Adams
Gavin implemented the buttons for MS, M-, and multiplication. He also did much of the styling and css-grid layout for the web page. Gavin created functionality for adding values to the display and helped in setting up event listeners for the digits.
